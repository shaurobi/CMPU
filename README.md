# CTPU

Cisco Tasmania Partner Update is a tool created to help promote using Spark as a information distribution tool for Cisco Partners.

The tool will:

* Allow partners to register for product updates
* Allow partners to unregister from product updates
* Allow partners to see who is registered from their company
* Allow Cisco SE to push product/event updates to registered users


# Setup

A config.py file needs to be created under an instance folder with the following variables:

* BOTTOKEN = "Spark Bot Token"
* TUNNEL = "web address for Spark to talk to your server"
* ADMIN = 'your spark email address for admin purposes'
