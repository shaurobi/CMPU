Cisco Tasmania Partner Update is a tool created to help promote using Spark as a information distribution tool for Cisco Partners.

The tool will:

* Allow partners to register for product updates
* Allow partners to unregister from product updates
* Allow partners to see who is registered from their company
* Allow Cisco SE to push product/event updates to registered users
